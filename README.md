# My First Website
Site de Casamento Pamela e Henrique
Wedding Website Pamela e Henrique

This was my first website. I started this project in July 2015, and I deployed it to production by December 2015.

I am very happy with the website success. It has a kind of "cross-found system" for the gifts session. At that time, my wife and I didn't find anything similar on the web.

Since I've started from scratch, with no knowledge on web programming, it was hard to put everything together. I would like to share with other these amazing resources that I found on the internet, which definitely helped me start.
